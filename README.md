# Examples

The purpose of this project is to explore different features of the zio system with a set of simple, well documented examples that may be of benefit to others

The subproject http4s1 gives examples of use of http4s with zio, including http4s authentication and custom encoder and decoder.
Tests use the latest zio-test library

The streams subproject is to contain examples of use of zio streams. But it is currently at very early stages
